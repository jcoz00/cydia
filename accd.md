Disable Adobe's checks that kick you off Creative Cloud! (I do not support piracy)

### What is it?

This file prohibits Adobe's checks that prevent you from using your Creative Cloud apps after the trial period is over.

### How do I do it?

1. Make sure that you are signed in to Adobe Creative Cloud.
2. Download your respective application from Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Lightroom, etc.) DO NOT OPEN IT
3. Navigate to the application in your Applications folder
4. Right-Click the app and select "Show Package Contents"
5. Open the folder "Frameworks"
6. Place the hacked file in the folder and select "Replace"
7. That's it!

NOTICE: If you decide to update one of your applications, you will have to repeat this process.
